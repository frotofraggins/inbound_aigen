# Historical Documentation Archive (2026-01-29)

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by consolidated guides.

## Why These Were Archived

These documents served their purpose during development but are now redundant because:

1. **Phase Documentation** - Historical snapshots of specific deployment phases. Final state is in SYSTEM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
2. **Session Handoffs** - Notes from specific work sessions. No longer relevant.
3. **Status Snapshots** - Point-in-time system status. Current status is in main docs.
4. **Debugging History** - Specific troubleshooting sessions. Patterns captured in TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md
5. **Redundant Explanations** - Information now consolidated into fewer, better-organized docs.

## What to Read Instead

For current information, see the essential docs in `/deploy/`:
- **SYSTEM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md** - Complete system overview
- **NEXT_SESSION_PHASES_3_4.md** - Implementation roadmap
- **RUNBOOK.md** - Operations guide
- **TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md** - Debugging reference
- **AI_PIPELINE_EXPLAINED.md** - Architecture details
- **MULTI_ACCOUNT_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md** - Account management

## Retrieval

If you need information from these archived docs, they're preserved here. However, the essential information has been integrated into the active documentation.
